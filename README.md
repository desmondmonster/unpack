# Unpack

This tiny Elixir drop let's you reach in and unpack any value from a nested map. Returns nil for bad keys, unloaded associations, or empty maps.

# Examples
```elixir
struct = %{player: %{game: %{id: "game-id"}}}
Unpack.get(struct, [:player, :game, :id])
=> "game-id"

struct = %{player: %Ecto.Association.NotLoaded{}}
Unpack.get(struct, [:player, :game, :id])
=> nil
```
